## Motivation:
The motivation behind this project is exploring how data visualization tools work.
In the long run I intend to have graphs using sports metrics ( already implemented in a very rough form)  and display GPS tracks using files provided by sports watches (GPX). 
This project uses data extracted from Garmin Devices using a package I created - [Garmin Tcx Parser](https://github.com/JMarques1196/garmin-tcx-parser)

## Scope of this project:
* React + Typescript
* Vitest
* GH Actions Ci/CD
* Recharts for sports related metrics visualization, gathered from a Garmin File
* Leaflet for latitude and longitude visualization
* Unit tests using Vitest
